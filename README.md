Problem Statement:
 create an accurate and user-friendly streamlit tool that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features. 
 This tool should be deployed as an interactive web application for both customers and sales representatives to use seamlessly.
Approach:
   1)Data Processing
    Import and concatenate dataset.
    Handling Missing Values.
    Standardising Data Formats.
    Encoding Categorical Variables.
    Normalizing Numerical Features.
    Removing Outliers.
  2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Descriptive Statistics
    Data Visualization
    Feature Selection
  3) Model Development
    Train-Test Split.
    Model Selection.
    Model Training.
    Hyperparameter Tuning.
 4) Model Evaluation
   Performance Metrics-Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.
   Model Comparison.
 5)Optimization
   Feature Engineering
   Regularization-Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularization.
